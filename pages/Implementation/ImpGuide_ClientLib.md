OpenID Connect can be utilised from many programming languages such as:

> * [C#](ImpGuide_ASPExample.html)
> * [Java](ImpGuide_Java_Example.html)
> * JavaScript
> * [Python](ImpGuide_PythonExample.html)

Each language can utilise a number of OpenID Connect helper libraries. NHS Digital does not enforce the use of any specific libraries but the developer should ensure that any library is compliant with the standard protocol.
