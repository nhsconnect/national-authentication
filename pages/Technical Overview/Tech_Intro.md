## Introduction

This section describes the basic concepts behind the NHS Identity.  

## NHS Identity
There are three stages to the NHS Identity  Service:

1 -  Creating an Identity

2 -  Authenticating an Identity 

This is establishing the user using an ID token using OpenID Connect

3 – Granting Access to an Identity to a resource server.


This is authorising the user to access a resource using OAuth 2.0

## Technical Concepts

The rest of these sections will provide an overview of:

1 – Open ID Connect:  used for Authentication

2 - OAuth 2.0: used for Authorisation

## NHS Identity Scope

There are two functional use cases

1 -  National Identity

2 -  Local Identity

This site will only cover the first use cases.
