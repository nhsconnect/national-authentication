The API Gateway is a specific instance of the authorisation service that protects national APIâ€™s. 

The capabilities of the CAS API Gateway are:

* Can throttle client client traffic into each API micro service
* Acts as a Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) abstracting authorisation from the API leaving developers to concentrate on functionality
* Can perform translation functions to account for different protocols
* Can provide some limited API analytics
