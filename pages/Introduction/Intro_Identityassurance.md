summary: A brief introduction to NHS Identity Assurance Service
---

NHS Identity’s Assurance service ensures that the applicant is who they claim to be to a stated level of certitude. This includes presentation, validation, and verification of the minimum attributes necessary to accomplish identity proofing.

The level of Identity Assurance would be chosen based on the client’s risk profile and the potential harm that could be caused by an attacker making a successful false claim of an identity. The three Identity Assurance Levels (IALs) offered by NHS Identity are as follows:

> * IAL1: There is no requirement to link the applicant to a specific real-life identity. Any attributes provided in conjunction with the authentication process are self-asserted or should be treated as such.
> * IAL2: Evidence supports the real-world existence of the claimed identity and verifies that the applicant is appropriately associated with this real-world identity. IAL2 introduces the need for either remote or physically-present identity proofing. Attributes can be asserted by Credential Service Providers (CSPs) to Relying Parties (RPs) in support of pseudonymous identity with verified attributes.
> * IAL3: Physical presence is required for identity proofing. Identifying attributes must be verified by an authorized and trained representative of the CSP. As with IAL2, attributes can be asserted by CSPs to RPs in support of pseudonymous identity with verified attributes.

NHS Identity is in the process of finalizing the user journeys to support all Identity assurance levels ( IAL1-IAL3 ).

The next section describes the user registration journey for Identity Assurance Level 1. The user journey's related to the other IALs will be published shortly.
