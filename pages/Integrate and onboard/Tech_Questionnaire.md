Third parties would need to download the Service Assessment Questionnaire [here](docs/ServiceAssessmentQuestionnair.xlsx) 

The questionnaire should be answered to the best of your knowledge and sent to **nhs.identity@nhs.net**. The NHS Identity team will then assess your requirements and confirm your suitability and readiness to use NHS Identity.
