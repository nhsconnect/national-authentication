The third party interested in NHS identity should meet certain minimum pre-requisites to be able to be considered into the NHS Identity’s roadmap. They are as mentioned below:

> * The applications and services accessed on the user’s devices should be Open ID Connect (OIDC) enabled. [Please refer to the next sections on instructions to set up OIDC].
> * If the third party is interested to offer a single sign on across all their applications, then the applications and services accessed on the user’s devices should be able to refer to the single sign on **token**.
> * If the third party wants its user to access their applications that meet IAL Level 3 guidelines and would like to use the latest authentication mechanisms, then NHS Identity recommends the user's computers and laptops to be upgraded to Windows 10 with Trusted Platform Module 2.0 (TPM 2.0) and version 1803 or above to be able to utilize the latest authentication mechanisms.
