**The KBA module uses personal Q&Aâ€™s to validate the user. This is usually combined with other forms of validation.**


Knowledge-based authentication (KBA) is an authentication scheme in which the user is asked to answer at least one "secret" question. KBA is often used as a component in multifactor authentication (MFA) and for self-service password retrieval.
