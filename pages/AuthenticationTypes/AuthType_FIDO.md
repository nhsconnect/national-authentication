FIDO stands for Fast Identity Online. It is an authentication method designed to leverage and trust the local in-built capabilities of devices to validate who the user is e.g. fingerprint readers, facial recognition etc..FIDO is managed and promoted by a group known as the FIDO Alliance who are sponsored by industry giants such as Microsoft and Google amongst others.

The main goal of the FIDO Alliance is to provide standardized interfaces, so websites can use Windows Hello and other biometric device features across browsers. The FIDO Alliance has submitted the FIDO 2.0 proposal to the W3C body and the newly formed Web Authentication working group is standardizing these APIs in the W3C Web Authentication specification.
The Web Authentication specification defines two authentication scenarios: passwordless and two factor.

 In the passwordless case, the user does not need to log into the web page using a user name or password â€“ they can login solely using Windows Hello or any FIDO compliant device biometric. 

In the two factor case, the user logs in normally using a username and password, but Windows Hello or the device biometric is used as a second factor check to make the overall authentication stronger.
NHS Digital are looking to introduce FIDO as an authentication choice at the end of 2018.
