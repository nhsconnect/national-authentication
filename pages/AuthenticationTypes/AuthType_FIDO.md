FIDO stands for Fast Identity Online. It is an authentication method designed to leverage and trust the local in-built capabilities (e.g. fingerprint readers, facial recognition etc) of devices to validate who the user is. 

NHS Identity is introducing FIDO2 as an authentication choice which will introduce a new era of ubiquitous, hardware-backed FIDO Authentication protection for everyone using the internet. 

FIDO2 is comprised of the W3C’s Web Authentication specification (WebAuthn) and FIDO’s corresponding Client-to-Authenticator Protocol (CTAP), which collectively will enable users to leverage common devices to easily authenticate to online services — in both mobile and desktop environments.

WebAuthn defines a standard web API that can be built into browsers and related web platform infrastructure to enable online services to use FIDO Authentication. CTAP enables external devices such as mobile handsets or FIDO2 Security Keys to work with WebAuthn and serve as authenticators to desktop applications and web services.

Major web browsers including Chrome, Firefox and Microsoft Edge have implemented the standards; Android, Windows 10 and related Microsoft technologies also will have built-in support for FIDO2 Authentication.

Enterprises and online service providers looking to protect themselves and their customers from the risks associated with passwords - including phishing, man-in-the-middle and attacks using stolen credentials - can soon use standards-based strong authentication that works through the browser. Using FIDO2 Authentication enables online services to provide choice to users from an interoperable ecosystem of devices people use every day like mobile phones and security keys.
