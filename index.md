NHS Identity serves as the foundation for our simple and comprehensive Identity and Access Management solution. We help our clients improve the productivity and connectivity of their users and partners. 

NHS identity considers digital identity as the on-line persona of a subject. NHS Identity is a cloud-based solution that provides digital identity services for national health and social care workers. It’s a powerful mechanism as it can be consumed many times from a single logon. It can also be linked with every day devices to provide extra contextual information about that user and it can profile the characteristics of the owner.

NHS Identity facilitates cross organizational access without the need for costly middle ware components that can tie one organization to another. It also caters for scale and simplifies management with one central service to store authentication and access rules.

The primary objectives of NHS Identity service are to provide:

> * A sufficient level of **assurance** that the user is who they say they are for the sensitivity of digital information they are accessing.
> * A **trusted** secure token representing the user’s national digital identity in an industry recognized format.
> * A frictionless sign-on process that aligns to the user working patterns and only asking for additional action when necessary. A single sign-on is the target.
> * Support for all IT platforms and devices whether that be a PC, laptop, tablet, phone or wearable.
> * Interaction with the service from any UK based location (N3 not required).
> * To be available 24x7, 365 days a year.
> * To abstract **identity & access into a cloud service** that can be easily consumed by many client applications and services no matter what language they are written in and to shield those clients from any changes that happen in that service.
> * **Protection** for national services ensuring the requester has **legitimate rights** to the resources requested.
